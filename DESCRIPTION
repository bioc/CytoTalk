Description: Perform de novo construction of signal transduction networks using
    single-cell transcriptomic data (scRNA-seq). The CytoTalk process constructs
    an integrated network of intracellular and intercellular functional gene
    interactions, generating useful graphical output for investigation of cell-
    cell communication within and between cell types.
